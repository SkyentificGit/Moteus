This is a capable Python library to control Skyentific Actuators. 

It is completely based on original Moteus library: https://github.com/mjbots/moteus/tree/main/lib/python , I just did super tiny minor modifications 

To use it in linux you need to install: sudo apt install python3-serial and setup UDEV rules: https://github.com/mjbots/fdcanusb/blob/master/70-fdcanusb.rules
