This is a simple Python library to control Skyentific Actuators.

It is completely based on Damian Lickindorf library: https://github.com/dlickindorf/moteus_canFD_serial . I just added the example.

To use it in linux you need to install: sudo apt install python3-serial and setup UDEV rules: https://github.com/mjbots/fdcanusb/blob/master/70-fdcanusb.rules
